/*
 * Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and
 * outputs the result. For example:
 * + 100 3.14
 * * 4 5
 * Read the operation into a string called operation and use an
 * if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example,
 * if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double.
 * Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div
 * with their obvious meanings.
